# Alchemy

C# library to log exceptions on .Net applications.

The idea was to create a tool as powerful as [log4net](http://logging.apache.org/log4net/) with as little configuration effort as possible.

The project is on C# 3.5 and all the comments are in Brazilian Portuguese.

Unfortunatelly the project has never been properly completed due to other missions that always pushed the project forward.
